random.randrange(start, stop[, step]) 
-> Return a randomly selected element
   from range(start, stop, step). 
   This is equivalent to choice(range(start, stop, step)),but does not actually build a range object.

random.randint(a, b) 
-> Return a random integer N such that a <= N <= b.

random.choice(seq) 
-> Return a random element from the non-empty sequence seq.
