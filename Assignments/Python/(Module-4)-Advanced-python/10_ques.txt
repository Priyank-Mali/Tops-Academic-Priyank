Python supports operator and function overloading.

Method overloading
-> Overloading is the ability to define the same method, with the same name
   but with a different number of arguments and types.
-> It's the ability of one function to perform different tasks, depending on the
   number of parameters or the types of the parameters.

Operator Overloading
-> Python operators work for built-in classes.
-> But same operator behaves differently with different types.
-> For example, the + operator will, perform arithmetic addition on two
numbers, merge two lists and concatenate two strings.
-> This feature in Python, that allows same operator to have different meaning
according to the context is called operator overloading.
